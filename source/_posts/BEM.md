There are plenty of methodologies.
* Object-Oriented CSS (OOCSS)
* Block, Element, Modifier (BEM)
* Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACSS)
* SUITCSS
* Atomic CSS
* And so on...

# Blocks, Elements and Modifiers
## Block
Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.
Examples: header, container, menu, checkbox, input
## Element
A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block.
Examples: menu item, list item, checkbox caption, header title
## Modifier
A flag on a block or element. Use them to change appearance or behavior.
Examples: disabled, highlighted, checked, fixed, size big, color yellow
